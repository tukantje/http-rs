# Conventional Commits

Conventional commits must follow the format: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

## Valid Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

## Format Rules
- Type is required and must be lowercase
- Scope is optional and should be in parentheses: `(scope)`
- Description is required and should be concise
- Use imperative mood for description (e.g., "add", "fix", "update")
- Breaking changes should be indicated by adding `!` after type/scope or including "BREAKING CHANGE:" in the footer

## Examples
```
feat: add user authentication
fix(api): resolve null pointer exception
docs(readme): update installation instructions
feat(auth)!: implement OAuth2 login
```

## Breaking Changes
For breaking changes, use one of these formats:
```
feat!: implement new API structure
feat(auth)!: change authentication flow
```
Or include in commit body:
```
feat: implement new API structure

BREAKING CHANGE: The API endpoints have been completely redesigned
```

## Commit Body
The commit body is optional and should provide additional context about the changes made. Use the body to explain:

- **What** the change does and **why** it was necessary
- Any **trade-offs** or **limitations** of the implementation
- **Migration instructions** for breaking changes
- **Testing considerations** or **edge cases** addressed

Body lines should be wrapped at 72 characters and separated from the subject by a blank line.

### Body Examples
```
feat: add support for custom HTTP headers

Add support for custom headers in HTTP requests and responses.
Headers can now be specified using the new `headers` parameter
in both request and response builders.

This enables more flexible API interactions and better control
over HTTP communication.
```

```
fix: resolve memory leak in connection pooling

Fix memory leak that occurred when connections were not properly
closed under high concurrency scenarios.

The issue was caused by weak references not being cleared
when the connection pool reached its maximum capacity.
```

## Footer
The footer is optional and contains metadata about the commit. Common footer entries include:

- **Breaking change notes**: `BREAKING CHANGE: description`
- **Issue references**: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`, `Resolves #789`
- **Co-authors**: `Co-authored-by: Name <email@example.com>`
- **Reviewed-by**: `Reviewed-by: Name <email@example.com>`
- **Signed-off-by**: `Signed-off-by: Name <email@example.com>` (for legal purposes)
- **Refs**: `Refs: #123, #456` (for related issues)

Footer entries should be separated from the body by a blank line and formatted as `Token: description`.

### Footer Examples
```
Closes #42
```

```
BREAKING CHANGE: The `timeout` parameter now expects milliseconds instead of seconds

Migration: Update all timeout values by multiplying by 1000
```

## Complete Commit Message Examples

### Simple Feature Commit
```
feat: add dark mode toggle

Add a toggle button in the header to switch between light and dark themes.
The preference is stored in localStorage for persistence across sessions.
```

### Feature with Body and Footer
```
feat: implement user authentication system

Add comprehensive authentication system with login, logout, and session management.
Includes JWT token handling, password hashing, and secure cookie storage.

The implementation uses bcrypt for password hashing with 12 salt rounds
and includes rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.

BREAKING CHANGE: The `/api/user` endpoint now requires authentication

To migrate: Update client code to include Authorization header with JWT token
Closes #123
```

### Fix with Multiple Footer Entries
```
fix: resolve race condition in database transactions

Fix race condition that could occur during concurrent database writes
by implementing proper locking mechanisms.

The issue manifested as occasional data corruption when multiple
processes updated the same records simultaneously.

Co-authored-by: Alice Johnson <alice@company.com>
Reviewed-by: Bob Wilson <bob@company.com>
Fixes #456
Refs: #789, #101
```

### Breaking Change with Migration Guide
```
feat!: migrate to new configuration format

Replace JSON configuration files with YAML format for better readability
and support for comments.

YAML provides clearer syntax and allows inline documentation,
making configuration files more maintainable.

BREAKING CHANGE: Configuration files must be converted from JSON to YAML

Migration steps:
1. Rename config.json to config.yaml
2. Convert JSON syntax to YAML syntax
3. Update any scripts that read the configuration file

Example migration:
JSON: {"database": {"host": "localhost", "port": 5432}}
YAML: database:
        host: localhost
        port: 5432

Closes #234
